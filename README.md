### Hi there, I'm Sylvain Rey.

**Senior Backend & Blockchain Engineer**
*Bridging the gap between Enterprise-grade Architecture and Decentralized Finance.*

I design and build distributed systems where **data integrity**, **throughput**, and **fault tolerance** are non-negotiable. With 7+ years of engineering experience (including 3 years deep-diving into Web3 & RWA), I specialize in scaling heavy-duty Java applications that interact with blockchain states.

#### 🔧 Core Engineering Focus
*   **Backend Architecture:** Java 21, Spring Boot 3, Event-Driven Architecture (Kafka/RabbitMQ).
*   **Blockchain Integration:** High-frequency indexing, EVM interaction (Web3j), Smart Contract integration (Solidity).
*   **Reliability:** Handling Reorgs, Idempotency patterns, Distributed Consistency.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (TimescaleDB for time-series), Redis.

#### 🚀 Featured Architecture Showcase
**[high-throughput-blockchain-indexer](https://github.com/Slymaster/high-throughput-blockchain-indexer)**
*An architectural reference implementation for a real-time EVM data ingestion engine handling chain reorganizations and high-volume event streams.*
*(Design patterns: Producer-Consumer, Deep Chain Validation, Atomic Writes).*

#### 📜 Background
*   **Previously:** Engineering critical tokenization systems at **VeraOne / AuCoffre**.
*   **Philosophy:** Type safety (Strongly typed > Loose typing), Observability first, Testing as documentation.
